# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t "hello"
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t("hello") %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   "true": "foo"
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at https://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

    filler_text: "Have you ever filled out your ballot papers and sent them in only later realizing that you do not know 
    what exactly changed when it was/wasn't accepted? Well, I am sure you felt like this at least once, otherwise 
    you wouldn't have came here. The mission of this webpage to make it easier to visualize what changed
    between two law text revisions. Type in the classified compilation number of the law you want to have a closer
    look at and select it to get redirected to the document page. There you can select two revisions and compare
    them."
